=== DELIVERABLES VERIFICATION ===

DELIVERABLE 1: Coca-Cola Stock Forecasting Pipeline
✓ Data acquisition: src/data_pipeline.py downloads 2 years KO data via yfinance
✓ Moving average smoothing: 20-30 day window applied in preprocessing
✓ Forecasting model: statsmodels SARIMA trained for 3-month (60-90 trading days)
✓ Metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE evaluated on test set
✓ W&B logging: All metrics/parameters/artifacts logged to W&B integration
✓ Model artifacts: Saved as /models/ko_sarima_model.pkl
✓ Reproducibility: Deterministic seed management (seed=42)

DELIVERABLE 2: Forecast Visualization & W&B Report
✓ Publication-ready plots:
  - /visualizations/ko_train_test_split.png (train/test visualization)
  - /visualizations/ko_moving_average_overlay.png (raw + MA)
  - /visualizations/ko_forecast_with_ci.png (forecast with confidence intervals)
  - /visualizations/ko_model_diagnostics.png (residuals, ACF/PACF)
✓ W&B artifacts: All plots uploaded as artifacts
✓ W&B dashboard: Metrics, parameters, and visualizations logged
✓ End-to-end tracking: Complete experiment lifecycle captured
